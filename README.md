The SparkFun SAM-M10Q GPS Breakout features the the SAM-M10Q chip-antenna module from u-blox<sup>&copy;</sup>. The SAM-M10Q can receive up to four GNSS constellations at once which improves time-to-fix and positional accuracy even in areas with limited view of the sky. The module includes a built-in chip antenna and is compatible with the L1 band on all five GNSS constellations (GPS L1 C/A, QZSS L1 C/A L1S, GLONASS L1OF, BeiDou B1C, and Galileo E1B/C). It has a horizontal position accuracy of 1.5 m, max update rate of 18 Hz when transmitting with just one GNSS constellation (max of 5Hz with 4 GNSS) and a cold start time to fix of 23 seconds. The board includes a rechargeable 3V/1mAh battery to provide backup power for up to four hours to maintain a hot start of just 1 second.
